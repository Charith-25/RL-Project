# Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Routing in Multi-Agent Garbage Collecting Systems
Overview
The project involves developing a reinforcement learning algorithm for multi-agent garbage collection systems in adaptive routing. The aim of the project is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of garbage collection by enabling garbage trucks to reroute themselves when one truck experiences a fault, any road closure occasion or any other such occurrences.
