# Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Routing in Multi-Agent Garbage Collecting Systems

## Overview
The project involves developing a reinforcement learning algorithm for multi-agent garbage collection systems in adaptive routing. The aim of the project is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of garbage collection by enabling garbage trucks to reroute themselves when one truck experiences a fault, any road closure occasion or any other such occurrences. 
## Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the principles of reinforcement learning and its application in multi-agent systems.
2. Understand the challenges of adaptive routing in multi-agent systems and how reinforcement learning  can address these challenges.
3. Develop proficiency in programming and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms in Python.
4. Gain experience in working with large datasets and designing graphical databases to support applications.

## Project Objectives:
1. Design and implement a simulation environment for multi-agent garbage collection systems using Python.
2. Develop a reinforcement learning algorithm that enables the garbage trucks to reroute themselves.
3. Evaluate the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithm.
4. Design and develop a graphical database to support the application and allow users to view and interact with system data in real-time.
